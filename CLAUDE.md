# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Follow README.md Instructions

**ALWAYS follow the README.md instructions when running this system!**

### Correct Way to Run the System:
```bash
# ALWAYS use the management scripts - they handle everything correctly
./start-proxy-system.sh                        # For default example app
./start-proxy-system.sh 'go run /app/myapp.go' # For custom app
./monitor-proxy.sh                             # Monitor the system
./test-proxy-capture.sh                        # Test captures
```

### NEVER Do This:
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - This runs as root and bypasses the proxy!
docker exec app go run main.go

# ❌ WRONG - Direct docker commands skip critical setup
docker compose up -d
```

### Key Requirements:
1. **Apps MUST run as appuser (UID 1000)** - The scripts handle this automatically
2. **Traffic from root is NOT intercepted** - This is by design to prevent loops
3. **Always use management scripts** - They ensure correct user, permissions, and setup

## Project Overview

This is a transparent HTTPS proxy system that captures all HTTP/HTTPS traffic without requiring proxy configuration. It uses Docker, mitmproxy, and iptables for transparent interception.

Key features:
- **Transparent interception** using iptables (no proxy settings needed)
- **Automatic certificate trust** without system installation  
- **User-based traffic filtering** - MUST run as appuser (UID 1000)
- **Management scripts** that handle all configuration automatically
- Dynamic route loading from JSON configuration files
- Hot reload when config files change using fsnotify
- API response capture proxy for recording real API responses
- Support for path parameters and response templating
- Automatic path normalization (IDs become `{id}` placeholders)

## Correct Development Commands

```bash
# Start the transparent proxy system (ALWAYS use this!)
./start-proxy-system.sh

# Monitor the system
./monitor-proxy.sh

# Test that captures are working
./test-proxy-capture.sh

# Rebuild after changes
./rebuild-proxy.sh

# For development with hot reload
./dev-rebuild.sh
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Mock Server** (`cmd/main.go`)
   - Loads route configurations from JSON files in `configs/` directory
   - Watches for file changes and hot-reloads automatically
   - Supports dynamic path parameters like `/accounts/{id}`
   - Returns 404 for undefined routes

2. **Capture Proxy** (`cmd/capture/main.go`)
   - Intercepts real API calls and records responses
   - Automatically normalizes paths (IDs become `{id}` placeholders)
   - Groups captures by service (accounts, wallet, ledger, etc.)
   - Outputs JSON files compatible with mock server format
   - Supports HTTPS via CONNECT tunneling (can't decrypt content)

3. **MITM Proxy** (Docker with mitmproxy)
   - Full HTTPS content decryption and capture
   - Automatic certificate generation
   - Works without admin rights (using environment variables)
   - Python script (`scripts/mitm_capture.py`) for custom capture logic
   - Same output format as capture proxy for compatibility

### Key Files
- `configs/*.json` - Route definition files (hot-reloaded)
- `captured/*.json` - Captured API responses (generated by proxy)

## Route Configuration Format

Routes are defined in JSON files under `configs/`:

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/v2/accounts/{id}",
      "status": 200,
      "headers": {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
      "delay": 100,
      "response": {
        "id": "{{id}}",
        "data": "value"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Path parameters use `{param}` syntax and are replaced with `{{param}}` in responses.

## Environment Variables

**Mock Server:**
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 8090)
- `CONFIG_PATH` - Config directory (default: ./configs)

**Capture Proxy:**
- `CAPTURE_PORT` - Proxy port (default: 8091)
- `OUTPUT_DIR` - Capture output directory (default: ./captured)
- `TRANSPARENT_MODE` - Enable transparent proxy mode (default: false)
- `*_API_URL` - Real API endpoints to proxy (ACCOUNTS_API_URL, WALLET_API_URL, etc.)

**MITM Proxy (for restricted environments):**
- `SSL_CERT_FILE` - Path to CA certificate for HTTPS trust (no admin needed)
- `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` - Python requests library CA bundle
- `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` - Node.js additional CA certificates
- `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` - Proxy settings for applications

## Capture Workflow

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Generate capture script
./capture-real-apis.sh intercept

# 2. Edit run-capture-proxy.sh with real API URLs
# 3. Run proxy
./run-capture-proxy.sh

# 4. Update app's .env to use proxy
# 5. Generate traffic
# 6. Save captures
curl http://localhost:8091/capture/save
```

### Manual Setup
1. Set real API URLs as environment variables
2. Run capture proxy: `go run cmd/capture/main.go`
3. Point your application to proxy URLs (e.g., http://localhost:8091/accounts)
4. Use the application to generate traffic
5. Save captures: `curl http://localhost:8091/capture/save`
6. Check status: `curl http://localhost:8091/capture/status`
7. Copy captured JSON from `captured/` to `configs/` for use as mocks

### Capture Proxy Features
- Automatically normalizes paths (numeric IDs → `{id}`)
- Groups captures by service type
- Preserves request bodies for POST/PUT/PATCH
- Outputs mock-server-compatible JSON format

## Testing

No formal test suite currently exists. Testing is done manually by:
1. Adding/modifying JSON config files in `configs/`
2. Verifying routes respond correctly via curl or application
3. Checking hot-reload by modifying configs while server runs
